''' PROJECT: PERFECT MATCH

The goal of this project is to match users to the college of their dreams. 

The first part of this project is data collection. We will create a csv file where we match colleges to a lisit of criteria, which we will continue to develop over the timeline of the project. To gather data, we will access public csv files to save time and energy.

The next step is to import all the csv data into a Python, with the help of the Python library pandas. 

The second part of the project is the algorithm. The code will ask the user for their preferences for factors related to the college, i.e. size, that are present in the colleges library. Then, using the get function Python will run through the list of colleges and append all colleges tha tmatch their preferences to a list. Then, by totalling the number of times a college is present in the list and converting this to a percentage, it will output the top five highest matches.
