''' PROJECT: PERFECT MATCH

The goal of this project is to match users to the college of their dreams. The algorithm will search the web for key words associated with colleges that fit into a predefined set of criteria. The user will then be asked a series of questions regarding these criteria (e.g. if the criterion is location, the user will be asked whether they prefer a big city or a small city) and the script will input these responses and find the colleges that most closely match their preferences (including % match).
